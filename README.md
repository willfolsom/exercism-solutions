Exercism provides learning tracks for languages with coding problems and prompts for each. More fun than standard LC.

They are divided by ```{language}/{prompt}/{code}```. Some of them have short READMEs to give the idea of what to expect. Others (like Hello World) should just be intuited.

### Go
In individual {prompt} directories, run ```go test``` to see that they pass.
