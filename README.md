# exercism-solutions
Exercism provides learning tracks for languages with coding problems and prompts for each, increasing fluency.

**I highly encourage folks to try to it out for themselves.** It's not about solutions so much as it is about learning.

My solutions are divided by ```{language}/{prompt}```. Some of them have short READMEs to give the idea of what to expect. Others (like Hello World) should just be intuited.

[Here is my Exercism profile.](https://exercism.io/profiles/willfolsom)

As of 6/6/21, I just have the readmes and snippets. Running is encouraged as you develop locally, or in the Kotlin / Go playgrounds online.
